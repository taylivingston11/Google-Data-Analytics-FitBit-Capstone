You have been asked to focus on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The insights you discover will then help guide marketing strategy for the company

Background Information:
As a junior data analyst, you are working on the analyst marketing team at Bellabeat.

Company Information:
Bellabeat is a high-tech health company that manufactures health-focused smart products including but not limited to, wellness watches, smart water bottle that tracks daily water intake, and a classic wellness tracker than can be worn as a bracelet, necklace, or a clip.
They pride themselves on being a tech-driven wellness company for women.

Bellabeat is a small successful company, but they have the potential to become a bigger company in the global smart device market. 

Business Task:
Analyze smart device data to gain insight to how consumers are using their smart devices. These insights will then help guide marketing strategy for the company.

Data:
1 month of data (4-12-16 – 5-12-16) was used via FitBit Fitness Tracker Data (CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through Mobius). This data set from Kaggle contains personal fitness tracker from thirty fitbit users. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users’ habits.

•	Data Limitations:
o	The data set is for one month of data. This is not enough to provide a comprehensive analysis and it calls into question the credibility of the provided data.


I used pgAdmin 4 to import the data sets. SQL was then used to analyze the data.


Imported Data Sets:
Daily_Activity
Sleep_Log
Weight_Log

Data Verification:
The data sets were first opened in Microsoft Excel to verify the initial count of rows.
I then used the COUNT SQL function in pgAdmin 4 to match the data in Microsoft Excel.

SELECT COUNT(Id) FROM daily_activity
SELECT COUNT(Id) FROM sleep_day
SELECT COUNT(Id) FROM weight_log


 
 
 


Data Cleaning:
After analyzing the tables, I noticed there were some users who did not input their data (they had ‘0’ for total steps, total distance, and tracker distance). These users were deleted from the data set as they could skew the results and provide an inaccurate analysis for the client.


A FULL OUTER JOIN was performed in pgAdmin to congregate the data. 

SELECT * FROM daily_activity
FULL OUTER JOIN sleep_day
ON daily_activity.id = sleep_day.id
FULL OUTER JOIN weight_log
ON sleep_day.id = weight_log.id

 



I filtered out the users who did not have any information for total steps, total distance, and tracker distance. Placing the count at 862.

SELECT * FROM daily_Activity
WHERE totaldistance != '0' AND trackerdistance != '0' AND totalsteps != '0'

SELECT COUNT(Id) FROM daily_Activity
WHERE totaldistance != '0' AND trackerdistance != '0' AND totalsteps != '0'

 

The number of unique ID’s is not consistent across the three data sets which reveals that the data may not be valid for accurate analysis.

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(Id)) FROM sleep_day
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(Id)) FROM daily_activity
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(Id)) FROM weight_log


 
 
 


Continuing to clean the data, duplicate values were checked for in each data set. I used a self-join to compare the trackerdistance values as they extend 8 decimal places, making the values less likely to be duplicated. The ID count was 33 which is the same ID count from the original daily activity data set. This confirms there are no duplicate entries in the daily activity dataset.

SELECT DISTINCT(da1.id), da1.activitydate
FROM daily_activity AS da1
JOIN daily_activity AS da2
ON da1.id = da2.id
WHERE da1.trackerdistance = da2.trackerdistance
GROUP BY da1.Id, da1.activitydate
ORDER BY da1.activitydate

There were duplicate rows in the sleep day dataset. I used the GROUPBY statement and DISTINCT feature in SQL to remove the duplicates, leaving 410 rows.

SELECT DISTINCT(id), sleepday
FROM sleep_day
GROUP BY sleepday, id
ORDER BY sleepday

Analyze:
I utilized Microsoft excel for data analysis. I checked all data sets for minimum, maximum, average, and medium as well as outliers. The average weight was 158lbs and BMI, 25. The average total number of steps taken was 8,319 and calories burned was 2361. The average user was sedentary for 966 minutes per day which equates to about 16 hours per day. Users were lightly active an average of 210 minutes per day. BellaBeat users slept for an average of 419 minutes per night, averaging 7 hours.
